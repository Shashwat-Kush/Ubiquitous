# Ubiquitous

OPen the Heatmap advanced folder.
First run the aisle.py program to select the area to e examined. We can do this by clicking for the area section and favourably create a closed section.
When made the first section, click "c" to create the second section and you can create a new section and this process continues. To terminate the program and store the sections successfully, we click "e" or "q"...cant remember...in class thats why.
Later on, run the main file and check the input file video and make sure that both the files in the aisle and main are same on which you have plotted the points.
Run the main file and let it process...We get three windows possibly...one is the original frame, other is the original heatmap and last one is the weighted average frame of the original frame and the overlay (frame on which the original heatmap is created).
